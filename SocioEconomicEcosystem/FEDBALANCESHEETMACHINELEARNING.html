<h3> Introduction: </h3>
 Well-designed banking system, investment, spending and consumption play a direct role in supporting and driving lending and economic growth. The economic growth affects banking sector liquidity, which in return affect the investment, spending and consumption. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which assets can be converted to cash.
 <br> <br>
During the last financial crisis which supposed to be caused by low liquidity instruments ( bonds, housing and financial assets ), the quantitative easing process was used to replace low liquidity instruments with high liquidity cash reserves. These new created cash reserves are considered as bank reserves. These <a target="alone"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_reserves"> bank reserves </a>  are a commercial banks' holdings of deposits in accounts with a central bank. 
 <br> <br>
 Under the fractional-reserve banking system, these new created cash reserves can be used as a credit easing, the commercial banks can use part of them as reserve requirements for lending to active agents in the economy and earn interest on the rest of these reserves(excess).  The term fractional reserve refers to the fraction of deposits held in bank reserves. For example, if a bank has 
 to lend $500 million to an investor/household/corporation, it must hold $50 million as reserve requirement in the central bank account ( 10%  as in American Federal Reserve). The investor/household/corporation's bank reiterate the same process again for new credit using the deposited money, it must hold $50 million as reserve requirement and lend $450 million to a second investor. This multiplier effect at the end, will turn $500 million to $5 billion as new created money in the banking system.
<br> <br>
The created bank reserves used to create credits via the fractional-reserve banking system end up in the central bank's balance sheet in the form of bonds or assets. The central bank used its balance sheet as the primary tool for enhancing financial stability, by "turning" low liquidity assets to high liquidity assets. How?
<br> <br>
These new credits to active agents in the economy, if any, will foster investment, spending and consumption to end recession and restart an economic growth. These new credits can be considered as a money supply process and are melted into money aggregates, M0, M1, M2. 
<br> <br>
The quantitative easing process created only cash reserves. If credits are conducted then money is supplied into the banking system using the principal of the fractional-reserve banking system. If no credit, no money is created into the banking system,  
an earning interest on the excess reserves is conducted.
<br> <br>
<h3> Question </h3>
This unconventional monetary policy led to this simple question:
 <br>  <br>
  <ul>
  <li type="square">   What is the impact of this quantitative easing on stock market and residential prices? </li>
   </ul>
This essay investigates the dynamic and long-run relationships between this unconventional quantitative easing monetary policy  and asset prices in US using weekly data from 2007 to now. Approaches based on formulating Granger causality test using vector autoregression (VAR) are used to identify the long-run relationships and directions of causality between asset prices and monetary variables,  <a href="./FEDBALANCESHEETMACHINELEARNING/FREDFED.html"> Pooled Visualization </a> using

M2 Money Stock (M2) is mainly related to the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Full Cap Index (WILL5000INDFC)  and S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index (CSUSHPINSA) dynamics. 

<br> <br>

10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate (WGS10YR) is mainly related to the dynamics of the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Full Cap Index (WILL5000INDFC). The investors are more confident with the availability of the cheap money supply to buy more stocks, more demand for stocks.
