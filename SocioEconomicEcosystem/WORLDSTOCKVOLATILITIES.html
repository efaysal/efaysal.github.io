<h3> Introduction: </h3>

The stock market volatility clustering, excess and “long memory” behavior are recognized as stylized properties present in most financial time series from stock market datasets. A clear introductory to volatility definitions is here <a href="http://www.probabilityandfinance.com/articles/47.pdf"> "What causes volatility?"</a>.
<br> <br> 
Various modeling methods have been proposed to highlight and provide insights about these volatility characteristics in terms of stock settings as economical conditions, behavior of market participants and the news event process, these methods were focused on estimating the stock volatility not necessary well-calibrated, the estimated volatilities of a number of different stocks may not be necessary comparable. Since the range of values of the estimated volatilities  varies widely, a machine learning algorithm to work properly needs a standardization/normalization treatment.
<br> <br> 
<ul>
    <li type="square"> <strong> Due to variation in stock settings, such as the used trading strategies, the quotes change 
across stocks accordingly. The measurement of volatility/uncertainty through standard deviation could be misleading for comparing two specific stock markets, i.e., the standard deviation is proportional to the mean. For consistent comparison of different stocks, a standardized volatility has to be used in place of the raw estimated volatility.  This can be useful
in measuring variation in a stock in relative terms(not in absolute).</strong></li> 
</ul>

<!--  A <strong> negative </strong> stock market return with a standard deviation equal to 1% can not be compared to a stock market with similar standard deviation and <strong>  positive </strong> return.  -->
<br> 
<h3> Research Points: </h3>

<ul>
    <li type="square"> An essential element in the computational process is to provide comparable numerical quantities. Given a number of different stock markets, the quantified volatility characteristics as tendencies & trends should be calculated using a modeling process of reducing measurements to a "neutral" or "standard" scale, i.e. important parameters in the learning process should have the same scale for a "fair" comparison between these different stock markets, trade-off between “fairness” and "efficiency" in the conducted comparison. </li> 
    <br>
     <li type="square"> To propose a time-frequency analysis approach, where volatility is decomposed into adaptive oscillatory processes which occur accordingly to different origins and mechanisms and are reversible processes, the direction can be "reversed". These adaptive oscillatory processes help to derive directional volatility measurements, indicating the direction in which volatility is situated, moving, or developing. This  provides summary measures beyond the stock market quality that includes binding event effects.</li>  
      <br>
     <li type="square"> Its implementation can be built up gradually over time and in response to specific social & economical conditions(events), the parameters identification and its quantification are feasible or releasable, i.e. the magnitude of the change in the volatility should be binding to these events and is required to be an accurate quantification of their impact ( less biased).</li> 
      <br>
     <li type="square"> <strong>  Importantly enough, the efforts have to be focusing on sound mathematical modeling of these points than waisting time on testing for stationarity or not. Ways out of the arbitrariness dilemma of Vector Auto-regression (VAR) Framework. </strong>
</ul>
<h3> Developmental Data Driven Analytics: </h3>
Our Algorithmic Data Driven Analytics(ADDA) takes a descriptive approach to studying properties of a stock market that follow from empirical observations(data) to score the stock volatility tendencies & trends under a "neutral" or "standard" scale. <strong> The volatility is decomposed into two "degrees of variation" caused by oscillatory processes which occur accordingly to different origins and mechanisms</strong>
<br> <br>
The numerical results related to major World stock market indices, since 1995 up to recently, are presented in these Interactive Charts: <strong>(a double click on a stock shows its associated curve) </strong>
<br> <br>
<ul>
    <li type="square">  <a href= "./WORLDSTOCKMARKET/RawVolatility.html"> Raw Volatility (Not Calibrated). </a> </li>
       <li type="square">  <a href= "./WORLDSTOCKMARKET/LearningDepthVolatilityZ.html"> Calibrated Volatility as function of two Oscillatory Processes I & II. </a> </li>
     <li type="square">  <a href= "./WORLDSTOCKMARKET/LearningDepthVolatilityX.html"> Oscillatory Process I. </a> </li>
     <li type="square">  <a href= "./WORLDSTOCKMARKET/LearningDepthVolatilityY.html"> Oscillatory Process II. </a> </li>
 
</ul>
The Interactive Chart displays data related to a number of stocks in ways that are meaningful for comparison. 
Straight line is used along the horizontal axis for a stock not having available quotes.
<br> <br>
<h3> Some Observations: </h3>
﻿﻿Upward spikes in volatility tendencies & trends are mainly associated to sharp stock market sell-offs. Declines in volatility are associated to steady gains in the market and tend to unfold with irregular bursts with a more or less random sequence of patterns, this was before the year 2007. After, our numerical result is showing cyclical volatility tendencies & trends in various ways, see
<a href= "./WORLDSTOCKMARKET/LearningDepthVolatilityX.html"> Oscillatory Process I. </a> 
<br> 
This cyclic volatility starts to be extraordinarily visible after the Financial crisis of 2007–2008. Whether across time, or across World stock markets, there is a strikingly high correlation between the depth volatility patterns over a period of 10 years. 
To be continued.
