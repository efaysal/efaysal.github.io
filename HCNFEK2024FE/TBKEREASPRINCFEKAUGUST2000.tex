\begin{abstract}
This paper explores a novel analogy between Fermat primes and significant evolutionary milestones, aiming to bridge mathematical concepts with biological and societal evolution. By mapping the progression from basic spatial constructs through matter and information to consciousness and civilization, this analogy provides a framework to understand complex systems and their development. The relationship with Mersenne primes and the implications for fields such as artificial intelligence and complexity theory are discussed. The analysis highlights the potential of this framework to inspire new perspectives on mathematical and evolutionary theories.
