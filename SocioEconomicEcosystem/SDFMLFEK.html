<h4> "Under Editing" </h4>
<br> <br>

<h1> Introduction &amp Motivation </h1>
Modern asset pricing theory is mainly focusing at understanding the prices of future claims that are subject to
future uncertainty. In the presence of any payoff uncertainty when undertaking an investment venture, investors will typically ask for risk compensation, and thus for some investment-specific return, which will discount the expected future payoff stream.
Importantly enough, the valuation process that investors undergo for investments with uncertain payoff typically depends on their statistical views on possible future outcomes, preferences-their attitudes toward risk, and, of course, the payoff structure itself.
<br> <br>
Mathematically, this asset pricing theory is an averaging discounting payoffs under different "states of affairs" and weighing them according to the investor’s probability and marginal preference structures. It comes to this  simple financial statement, the price of an asset equals its expected discounted payoff. 
<br>
The obtained discounting mechanism is called Stochastic Discounting Factor(SDF). 
<br> <br>
Its Mathematical formalism serves also to identify the fundamental differences in risk premia patterns between multi-assets portfolios that give rise to differences in their average returns via the variances and covariance operators, which captures the risk adjustment for risky assets. 
<br> <br>
The challenge in this asset pricing theory lies on the adequate identification of the investor’s probability and marginal preference structures and risk factors that are able to model empirically the actual SDF from a given market data-sets. In practice it is presumably infeasible to capture simultaneously all influencing factors in the actual SDF from the data.
<br> <br>
Usually, a parametrization of SDF is expressed as a function of the marginal rate of substitution of consumption of the investors who trade securities. In the current economy, shaped by the last global financial crisis 2007-2009, the class of consumption processes are not sufficient processes to model totally an exchange economy defined by unconventional monetary policy in which central banks purchase government securities or other securities from the financial market in order to lower interest rates and increase the money supply (Quantitative Easing(QE)) and may be followed by tight monetary policy environment that serves the opposite purpose to quantitative easing monetary policy. 
<br> <br>
As this unconventional monetary policy spreads from country to country, the way it affects the exchange rate of currency and domestic asset pricing is implicitly termed into the actual SDF. Thus, any major intervention in the economy, such as unconventional monetary policy, may not be fully captured by the consumption processes, this misspecification will hinder their ability to rationalize the statistics that characterized the actual SDF.   
<br> <br>
In general the stochastic discount factor is not observable as it may be strictly defined by many important non observable social, political and economical factors. In the actual open economies where central banks are still hunted by the shadow of last global financial crisis and yet challenging their attempt to influence current micro/macroeconomic outcomes by managing expectations about the future path of the policy rates, the asset prices are emerging via the trading behavior of large numbers of heterogeneous investors with access to both domestic and foreign bonds as each attempts to integrate effectively the central bank's forward guidance policies on the future distribution of asset returns. The Stochastic Discount Factor Models(SDFs) in such environment are difficult to characterize by using only few specific factors as consumption and so on.

<br> <br>
<h1> Machine Learning Perspective </h1>
An essential role that Machine Learning perspective can play in this modern asset pricing theory is to identify automatically(*) from market data-sets the fundamental differences in risk premia patterns between multi-assets portfolios that give rise to differences in their average returns. For instance, to deduce similar correlated assets to the actual pricing structure of Stochastic Discount Factor Models that may help to assess how the exposures of these assets to major intervention in the economy, as unconventional monetary policy and macroeconomic shocks and so on, are priced.
<br> <br>
(*)Using non-linear Machine Learning modeling is to take into consideration higher order terms that are important when analysing financial variables as risk premia or asset returns. Also in order to characterize non discernible SDF without committing to a particular asset pricing model, i.e., a marked departure from the statistical artifact hypothesis.
<br> <br>
Therefore, the aim is to use machine learning as an integrative part of the modern asset pricing theory, offering automated procedures for the characterization of Stochastic Discount Factor Models based on past market data-sets observations, unraveling
underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem of asset pricing under uncertainty.
