<strong>  In this work, the used numerical datasets are for informational use only and with an only purpose to illustrate numerically our research points. Most of these research points have been inspired by our seminal work in: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885064X99905095"> Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation of Diffusion</a>, in a way that can be directly applied to Stock Market Volatility Calculations.

<h3> Introduction: </h3>

The stock market volatility clustering, excess and “long memory” behavior are recognized as stylized properties present in most financial time series from stock market datasets(stock returns). A clear introductory to volatility definitions is here <a href="http://www.probabilityandfinance.com/articles/47.pdf"> "What causes volatility?"</a>.
<br> <br> 
Various modeling methods have been proposed to highlight and provide insights about these volatility characteristics in terms of stock settings as economical conditions, behavior of market participants and the news event process, these methods were focused on estimating the stock volatility that is not necessary well-calibrated for meaningful comparison, the estimated volatilities of a number of different stocks may not be necessary comparable. Since the range of values of the estimated volatilities varies widely, a machine learning algorithm needs a standardization/normalization treatment to this wildness in order to reduce the prediction error.
<br> <br> 
<ul>
    <li type="square">  Due to variation in stock settings, such as the used trading strategies, the quotes change 
across stocks accordingly. The measurement of volatility/uncertainty through standard deviation could be also misleading for comparing two specific stock markets, i.e. the standard deviation is proportional to the mean and must always be understood in the context of the mean of the data. For consistent comparison of different stocks, a standardized volatility has to be used in place of the raw estimated volatility.  This can be useful in measuring variation in a stock in relative terms(not in absolute).</li> 
</ul>

<!--  A <strong> negative </strong> stock market return with a standard deviation equal to 1% can not be compared to a stock market with similar standard deviation and <strong>  positive </strong> return.  -->
<br> 
<h3> Research Points: </h3>

<ul>
    <li type="square"> An essential element in the computational process is to provide comparable numerical quantities. Given a number of different stock markets, the quantified volatility characteristics as tendencies &amp trends should be calculated using a modeling process of reducing measurements to a "neutral" or "standard" scale, i.e. important parameters in the learning process should have the same scale for a "fair" comparison between these different stock markets, trade-off between “fairness” and "efficiency" in the conducted comparison. </li> 
    <br>
     <li type="square"> To propose a time-frequency analysis approach, where volatility is decomposed into adaptive oscillatory processes which occur accordingly to different origins and mechanisms and are reversible processes, the direction can be "reversed". These adaptive oscillatory processes help to derive directional volatility measurements, indicating the direction in which volatility is situated, moving, or developing. This  provides summary measures beyond the stock market quality that includes binding event effects.</li>  
      <br>
     <li type="square"> Its implementation can be built up gradually over time and in response to specific social and economical conditions(events), the parameters identification and its quantification are feasible or releasable, i.e. the magnitude of the change in the volatility should be binding to these events and is required to be an accurate quantification of their impact ( less biased).</li> 
      <br>
</ul>
<h3> Developmental Data Driven Analytics: </h3>
Algorithmic Data Driven Analytics(ADDA) takes a descriptive approach to studying properties of a stock market volatility that follow from empirical observations(realized quotes), i.e. to infer historical volatility structures from data and to score the stock volatility tendencies &amp trends under a "neutral" or "standard" scale. The historical volatility is decomposed into two oscillatory processes which occur accordingly to different origins and mechanisms. The patterns that will be characterized by these oscillatory processes are called the "Depth Volatility Patterns".

The Interactive Chart displays data related to a number of stocks in ways that are meaningful for comparison. 
Straight line is used along the horizontal axis for a stock not having available quotes.

This is the historical volatility  calculated from known past returns of a security. Implied volatility, a forward-looking and subjective measure, differs from historical volatility because the latter is calculated from known past returns of a security.


<br> <br>
<h3> Some Observations: </h3>
﻿﻿Upward spikes in volatility tendencies &amp trends are mainly associated to sharp stock market sell-offs. Declines in volatility are associated to steady gains in the market and tend to unfold with irregular bursts with a more or less random sequence of patterns, this was before the year 2007. After, our numerical result is showing cyclical volatility tendencies &amp trends in various ways, see
<a href= "./WORLDSTOCKMARKET/LearningDepthVolatility_WORLD_X_4W_.html"> Oscillatory Process I. </a> 
<br> 
This cyclic volatility starts to be extraordinarily visible after the Financial crisis of 2007–2008. Whether across time, or across World stock markets, there is a strikingly high correlation between the depth volatility patterns over a period of 10 years. 
Yet signs of friction in different parts of Major World Stock Markets raise many questions about how long this recently realized  streak of low volatility can continue, and point to the challenges that World Economy to face in a rising volatility era.
<br> <br>  
The healthiest stock markets should express a volatility commensurate with genuine fundamental economic factors and their 
inherited uncertainties. The moves in the stock markets are always accompanied by increased volatility if bad events are affecting the fundamental economic factors (crisis 2007-2008, for instance). If they are just showing a steady low-volatility streak, something needs to be investigated, not to be ignored till the next crisis.
