    <h4> Definition: statistical power is the probability of demonstrating statistical significance if the hypothesis of the study is true. </h4> 

  <h2> Aim &amp Motivation  </h2> 
  Enrolling a number of participants into a cohort with an adequate statistical power leads to an accurate and reliable process to discover biological markers to signal increased or decreased risk of developing specific diseases. 
  These biological markers provide accurate and reliable predictions to empower study participants or new ones with information to improve their own health. By taking into account individual differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology, these biological markers are the focus of the Precision Medicine Project.
  <br>  <br>
  The Precision Medicine Project aims to extract a comprehensive scientific knowledge to be tailored to the individual patient using
   <a target="alone"  href="https://allofus.nih.gov/"> cohort studies </a> with goal to foster understanding of health and disease.
 <br>  <br>
 In this essay, we consider that the collected cohort has a number of participants from a single survival population that can be separated into two sub-cohorts one with better(healthy state) and the other with worse(developing a non-healthy state) survival prognoses using an hypothetic biological marker that needs to be discovered and assessed during the study.
 <br>
  Several elements may affect the statistical power of cohort, the inherent stochasticity in the participants collection(study design), follow up(censoring), hypothetic biological marker measurements( precise/efficient/accurate technologies), cut-point finding methods and so on.
  <br>  <br>
We provide an Informatics Solution with the potential to mimic a real cohort collection with a goal to simulate scenarios quasi-close to the encountered stochasticity in reality. These simulation scenarios will facilitate a learning knowledge representations for a wide range of variabilities with an end point to form predictive analytics to study the difference in the survival of two prognostic subgroups and to assess its figure of merit as whether they lead to the identification of the optimal cut-point providing the most useful information for the considered cohort study.
 <br>  <br>
      <h2>   Introduction  </h2>
  
  We are interested by this problem where a medical status, D, is supposed to be positively correlated with a marker M. 
   <br> 
 The first group called positive ( where D=1 ) is expected to have the following condition, M >= m where m is a specific cut off. 
  <br> 
The second group called negative ( where D=0 ) is expected to have the following condition, M < m where m is a specific cut off. 
 <br>  <br> 
As a realistic  project, we consider the cumulative approach: the marker of interest is measured at baseline and the project is interested in the prognostic properties of the marker up to a specific period of time t, i.e. D(t) == 1 or D(t) == 0.
 <br> <br>
For this cumulative approach, the sensitivity and specificity for Time To Event, T, are defined as:
<br><br>
<ul>
   <li type="square">  The sensitivity associated to a given cut point m at time t is defined as:
<br> 
Sen(m,t) =P( M >= m | T <= t)  </li>
  <li type="square">  The specificity associated to a given cut point m at time t is defined as:
<br> 
Spe (m,t) =P( M < m | T > t)  </li>
</ul>
The sensitivity and specificity quantities are fundamental to evaluate:
<ul>
   <li type="square">  the survival of positive  group  at time t, SurvPositive(t).</li>
    <li type="square">  the survival of negative  group  at time t, SurvNegative(t).</li>
    <li type="square">  the difference in survival   at time t, SurvNegative(t) - SurvPositive(t).</li>
</ul>
These survival quantities can be computed using a number of probability formulations that only hold valid in the absence of censoring. The presence of censoring may affect badly the accuracy of the estimated survival quantities.
<br> <br> 
 <h3>   Terminology  </h3>
Given a specific marker and a given cut off to define negative/positive groups, we define for a time-point t:

<!-- , following the <a target="alone"  href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01480.pdf"> the terminology in this work </a> -->
<br> <br> 
<ul>
   <li type="square"> True Negatives (TN) as patients in negative group who did not experienced the event before time point t.</li> 
<li type="square">   False Negatives (FN) as patients in negative group who experienced the event before time point t.</li>
<br> 
      <li type="square"> True Positive (TP) as patients in positive group who experienced the event before time point t.</li> 
<li type="square"> False Positive (FP) as patients in positive group who did not experienced the event before time point t.</li>
</ul>

The clinicians are only interested to interpret test results on the basis of tested population, i.e crucially important, the predictive values of the test:

<br><br>
<ul>
<li type="square"> Positive predictive value is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease.</li> 
<li type="square"> Negative predictive value is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly don't have the disease.</li>

</ul>

<br><br>

With this simple diagnostic test in absence of censoring, the calculations of the sensitivity and specificity are straightforward.
The values of positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) with the knowledge of prevalence* are computed using the sensitivity and specificity values. 
<br><br>
*The prevalence is the proportion of positive patients in the
population, also known as the prior probability of being positive. It is a measure
independent of the validation dataset.

 <h3> Using the fundamental rules relating marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities, the survival of positive and negative patients are evaluated  at time t  as: </h3>
<ul>
   <li type="square">  SurvPositive(t) = 1-PPV(t)
<li type="square">    SurvNegative(t) = NPV(t)
</ul>
The difference  in the survival is given by:
<center>
    <p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span
style='color:blue'> DiS(t)=SurvNegative(t)-SurvPositive(t) </p>
</center>
Its analytical form is 
<center>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span
style='color:blue'> DiS = A / (B*C) </p>
</center>
where 
<center>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span
style='color:blue'> A = prevalence*(1-prevalence)*(specificity+sensitivity-1)
</center>
<center>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span
style='color:blue'> B = sensitivity*prevalence+(1-specificity)*(1-prevalence)
</center>
<center>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span
style='color:blue'> C = (1-sensitivity)*prevalence+specificity*(1-prevalence)
</center>

<br> <br> 
For a detailed evaluation/analysis of this formulation, see the 
 <a target="alone"  href="./NIHcohortBIGITC.html"> difference  in the survival in the absence of censoring. </a>
<br> <br> 
<h3> Normally a  diagnostic test is particularly to be attended to do good, and not to do harm. When the marker provides a random diagnostic test: </h3>
Sensitivity = 0.5 and specificity = 0.5, then 
<center>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span
style='color:blue'> DiS = 0 </p>
</center>
This scenario may happen when the marker was selected as showing an adequate difference in the survival using ad hoc cohorts. However, when applied to an unseen large population, the marker is just a random diagnostic test to detect the disease:
<br> <br> 
<ul>
    <li type="square">  This marker is violating totally the principle "first, do no harm".</li>
</ul>
 If the marker is based on pseudo-scientific facts and even confirmed by multiple ad hoc cohort studies as good, may present a serious miss-classification at the level of an unseen large population, not able to discern what is present or not able to predict the future. 
<br> <br> 
Serious scientific validation should be conducted to avoid this scenario. It may that artificial intelligence in healthcare, using advanced algorithms and software to enhance human cognition in the analysis of complex medical data, will play a primordial proactive role than reactive. However if they are prone to error when an unseen case is presented then they are just useless. 
<br> <br> 

 <h3> Censoring is always a Fact. </h3>
A realistic dataset has always censored data and it is not possible to build a cohort standing always with perfect accuracy. We investigate simulation scenarios using datasets that mimic realistic dataset. We consider that the marker is a mixture of two Normal distributions, we assess the following points:
<ul>
  <li type="square"> Simulation/Visualization as an effective way to show the results given a number of values for the variables and parameters.</li>
<li type="square"> Estimating the numerical values associated to the difference in survival given a number of cut-points.</li>
<li type="square">  Feasibility to identify the best cut-point and so on.</li>  
</ul>
`
<h4>   Numerical Simulation Scenarios  </h4>

Informatics Solution can be made to predict almost any outcome. It would also generate primordial insights to reassess the cohort formation and consider new ideas about how to improve the cohort formation.
<br> <br>
The Time To Event is generated according to a parametric exponential model. Given cut point m at time t, the probabilities associated to the sensitivity, ~Sen(m,t), and the specificity, ~Spe (m,t), are calculated using Bayes formulas and estimated through the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator. The presence of censoring has an impact on the accuracy of the estimated values and dependents on its time distribution, i.e. early stage censoring or late stage censoring. The Kaplan–Meier estimator has a variance that can be computed using Greenwood's formula which is too sensitive to the censoring time distribution( early or late ). Some analyzed simulation scenarios are summarized in the listed examples.
